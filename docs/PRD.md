## üéÆ TL;DR
Midnight Mall is a fast-paced co-op survival experience where players scavenge a dark, abandoned shopping mall, build barricades, and outlast relentless night-time threats.
The core loop rewards exploration, teamwork, and quick decision-making across short, replayable nights.
Designed for core Roblox players, friend groups, and streamers, the MVP focuses on tight co-op mechanics, satisfying progression, and watchable moments.
