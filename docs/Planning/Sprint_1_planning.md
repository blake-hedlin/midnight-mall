## üéØ Sprint Objective

Build the vertical slice: **Day ‚Üí Loot ‚Üí Barricade ‚Üí Night ‚Üí Survive ‚Üí Dawn**.
Add hooks for currency and shop systems to reduce refactoring later. Focus remains on stable systems and clean code structure ‚Äî monetization is non-functional scaffolding only.

## üß† Stories, Prompts & Tracking

## Story 1 ‚Äî Lighting Cycle & Clock Controller ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Experience Beat**: Time shifts are cinematic beats. Players *feel* the world change (light, fog, banner, audio) without UI clutter.

```prompt
You are Claude Code implementing Story 1.
Context: Use LightingPresets (Day/Night/Dawn) from /docs/ux-context.md and module `ReplicatedStorage/Shared/LightingPresets.lua`. Clock already emits `Signals.DayStarted` / `Signals.NightStarted`.
Goal: Implement `LightingController` to tween Lighting between presets using `TWEEN_SCENE` and trigger `UI_Banner` + audio.
Acceptance:
- Day‚ÜíNight and Night‚ÜíDawn transitions tween in 1.5 s; no frame hitching.
- Apply Fog, Ambient, Brightness, Exposure, ColorShift per preset.
- Fire `UI_Banner` (text: "Night Falling" / "Dawn Breaking").
- Start/stop heartbeat loop on night start/end.
Files: `ServerScriptService/Systems/LightingController.server.lua`.
Test: Play 2 minutes and verify two full transitions; confirm banner timing matches lighting.
Sequence: precedes Story 5 (HUD), Story 4 (Enemy).
Checklist: Lighting tokens, TWEEN_SCENE, UI_Banner, SFX_NightStart.
```

**Refactor Completion Notes (Oct 2025):**
- ‚úÖ Updated transition duration from 3s to 1.5s (`TWEEN_SCENE` per ux-context.md)
- ‚úÖ Changed easing from `Sine` to `Quad` per UX tokens
- ‚úÖ Removed deprecated ColorCorrection properties (TintColor, Contrast, Saturation)
- ‚úÖ Added `ColorShift_Top` and `ColorShift_Bottom` to lighting tweens
- ‚úÖ Added `ExposureCompensation` to lighting tweens
- ‚úÖ Implemented **Dawn** phase support: Night ‚Üí Dawn ‚Üí Day sequence
- ‚úÖ Added UI_Banner triggers: "Night Falling" on NightStarted, "Dawn Breaking" on DayStarted
- ‚úÖ Added SFX_NightStart trigger (placeholder - awaits audio asset)
- ‚úÖ Implemented heartbeat loop start/stop functions (placeholder - awaits audio asset)
- ‚úÖ All lighting properties now pull from refactored `LightingPresets.lua` module
- üìù Note: Audio implementation uses TODO placeholders until SFX assets are added to SoundService

---

## Story 2 ‚Äî Loot System Pass 1 ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Experience Beat**: Calm scavenging with tactile feedback (lid nudge, dust puff) builds anticipation before night.

```prompt
Implement basic lootable containers.
Context: Parts tagged `LootCrate`; `LootRegistry` provides weighted items; `Inventory.lua` handles counts and `Signals.InventoryChanged`.
Goal: Interact (E) to roll loot; spawn item server‚Äëside; update HUD.
Acceptance:
- Each crate: cooldown indicator; 3 unique loots per Day phase.
- Visuals: puff particle + `SFX_LootOpen`, HUD count increases with 0.15 s tick animation.
- Resets on `DayStarted`.
Files: `ServerScriptService/Systems/Loot.server.lua`, `ReplicatedStorage/Shared/Inventory.lua`.
Test: Place 5 crates, loot them, verify uniqueness and HUD updates.
Sequence: follows Story 1 (for day detection); precedes Story 5 (HUD icons).
Checklist: UI_IconPrimary, Signals.InventoryChanged, TWEEN_FEEDBACK.
```

**REFACTOR COMPLETED** (sculptor/refactor-sprint1-story7):
- ‚úÖ Enhanced `Loot.server.lua` with complete visual/audio feedback system
- ‚úÖ Particle effect (dust puff) using ParticleEmitter with 15 particles per loot
- ‚úÖ SFX_LootOpen audio playback at -10 dB (Volume 0.3)
- ‚úÖ Lid nudge animation using TWEEN_FEEDBACK (0.15s) with reversal
- ‚úÖ Billboard cooldown indicator showing "X/3" loots remaining per crate
- ‚úÖ 3 unique loots per Day phase per crate (tracked in lootedCrates table)
- ‚úÖ Visual state changes: green fill when available, red when depleted
- ‚úÖ Crate transparency and color changes based on loot availability
- ‚úÖ All crates reset on `DayStarted` signal
- ‚úÖ Enhanced `ClientHUD.client.lua` with 0.15s tick animation for inventory updates
- ‚úÖ HUD inventory display animates with scale (16‚Üí20‚Üí16) and color pulse (green flash)
- ‚úÖ Tested with 8 loot crates across mall (exceeds 5 crate requirement)
- ‚úÖ Follows ux-context.md tokens: TWEEN_FEEDBACK, SFX_LootOpen, Signals.InventoryChanged

---

## Story 3 ‚Äî Barricade Placement & Durability ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Experience Beat**: Snappy, readable placement; boards feel weighty; repairs are quick but costly in time.

```prompt
Add barricade ghost/placement and durability.
Context: `BarricadeAnchor` tags mark slots; player needs 1 `wood` to place.
Goal: Green (valid)/Red (invalid) ghost preview; confirm places Board model with IntValue `Durability` (range 3‚Äì5).
Acceptance:
- Placement confirm animates snap in 0.2 s + `SFX_BoardPlace`.
- Enemies reduce `Durability`; when 0, board breaks with particle burst.
- Repair consumes `wood` and increases `Durability` by 1 up to max.
Files: `ServerScriptService/Systems/Barricade.server.lua`.
Test: Place and repair 3 boards; verify printed durability ticks align with hits.
Sequence: follows Story 2 (wood acquisition); precedes Story 4 (enemy validation).
Checklist: Ghost material = ForceField, TWEEN_FEEDBACK, SFX_BoardPlace.
```

**REFACTOR COMPLETED** (sculptor/refactor-sprint1-story7):
- ‚úÖ Enhanced `BarricadePreview.client.lua` with ForceField ghost material
- ‚úÖ Ghost size updated to match anchor size (6x6x0.5)

- ‚úÖ Dynamic color feedback: brown (healthy) ‚Üí yellow (damaged) ‚Üí red (critical)
- ‚úÖ Particle burst effect on board break (30 wood-colored particles)
- ‚úÖ Durability range: 3-5 hits (random on placement)
- ‚úÖ Repair increases durability by 1 (not 3) up to max per acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ Board destruction delayed 0.5s to show particle burst
- ‚úÖ Durability ticks printed to console for testing/validation
- ‚úÖ Tested with 6 barricade anchors across mall (exceeds 3 requirement)
- ‚úÖ Follows ux-context.md tokens: Ghost material ForceField, TWEEN_FEEDBACK, SFX_BoardPlace

---

## Story 4 ‚Äî Enemy Stub (Mannequin) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Experience Beat**: A simple pursuer that validates the defense loop; audible hits communicate danger.

```prompt
Create placeholder enemy to test barricades.
Context: Pathfind to nearest `BarricadeAnchor`/player at Night; despawn at Dawn.
Goal: Spawn on `NightStarted`, attack boards (damage per hit), play hit SFX, despawn on `DayStarted`.
Acceptance:
- Attack cadence 0.8 s; damage reduces board durability consistently.
- Server log shows damage ticks; client hears `SFX_EnemyHit`.
Files: `ServerScriptService/NPC/Mannequin.server.lua`.
Test: Observe enemy break at least one board per night if undefended.
Sequence: follows Story 3; precedes Story 6 (respawn validation).
Checklist: PathfindingService, Heartbeat loop volume 0.4‚Üí0 on Dawn.
```

**REFACTOR COMPLETED** (sculptor/refactor-sprint1-story7):

- ‚úÖ SFX_EnemyHit audio playback at -8 dB (Volume 0.4) on each attack
- ‚úÖ Improved targeting: prioritizes barricades over players
- ‚úÖ Smart pathfinding: finds nearest board within 50 studs, attacks when within 6 studs
- ‚úÖ Attack range optimization: stays at board and attacks repeatedly until destroyed
- ‚úÖ Heartbeat loop audio system with volume ramp (0‚Üí0.4 over 3s at night start)
- ‚úÖ Heartbeat fade out (0.4‚Üí0 over 1s at dawn)
- ‚úÖ Damage ticks logged to console with durability remaining
- ‚úÖ Spawns 2-3 enemies per night from tagged EnemySpawn points
- ‚úÖ Despawns all enemies on DayStarted signal
- ‚úÖ PathfindingService integration with dynamic re-targeting
- ‚úÖ With 2-3 enemies and 0.8s cadence, easily breaks multiple boards per night (boards have 3-5 HP)
- ‚úÖ Follows ux-context.md tokens: PathfindingService, heartbeat loop volume management

---

## Story 5 ‚Äî HUD & Banner Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Experience Beat**: HUD stays subtle; banners mark phase shifts. Inventory changes feel alive but not noisy.

```prompt
Enhance HUD for inventory/time + banners.
Context: `StarterGui/HUD` prototype exists. Use `UI_IconPrimary` and `UI_Banner` from /docs/ux-context.md.
Goal: Icons for Wood/Snack/Battery; time counter; show banner for Day/Night.
Acceptance:

- `UI_Banner` slide in 0.3 s, fade out 1.0 s with colorblind‚Äësafe contrast.
- No frame drops (>55 fps) on update bursts.
Files: `StarterGui/HUD/Init.client.lua`, `ReplicatedStorage/Shared/Signals.lua`.
Test: Loot items; observe real‚Äëtime updates; verify banner on NightStart.
Sequence: follows Story 1 & 2; precedes Story 10 (Shop button placement).
Checklist: Font_Primary, FS_MD, UI_Banner, TWEEN_UI.
```

**Refactor Completion Notes (Oct 2025):**
- ‚úÖ Moved time counter to **top-right** per `HUD_Root` specification (was top-left)
- ‚úÖ Moved inventory display to **bottom-left** per `HUD_Root` specification (was below time)
- ‚úÖ Updated all fonts to `GothamSemibold` (`Font_Primary`) with `FS_MD` (18px)
- ‚úÖ Updated HUD margins to **32px safe zones** per ux-context
- ‚úÖ Updated icon spacing to use **8px grid base** per ux-context
- ‚úÖ Implemented inventory count animations with **0.15s tick** (`TWEEN_FEEDBACK`) - text scales on update
- ‚úÖ Refactored banner to **full-width top banner** with slide-in animation
- ‚úÖ Banner slide-in: **0.3s** (`TWEEN_UI`) with Quad easing
- ‚úÖ Banner fade-out: **1.0s** with Quad easing
- ‚úÖ Added **colorblind-safe colors** for banners:

## Story 6 ‚Äî Spawn & Respawn Flow
**Experience Beat**: Death is a setback, not a stop; Dawn is the safe reset.

```prompt
Implement spawn points and dawn respawn.
Context: `workspace/AtriumSpawn` contains SpawnLocations.
Goal: Spawn at random on join; on death, queue respawn at next `DayStarted` (<=5 s).
Acceptance:
- Inventory resets on respawn; camera re‚Äëcenters with 1.0 s ease.
- No duplicate spawns at same exact frame; handle simultaneous joins.
Files: `ServerScriptService/Systems/Spawn.server.lua`.
Test: Die at night; verify respawn within 5 s of Dawn; inventory cleared.
Sequence: follows Story 4; precedes Story 7 (greybox traversal QA).
Checklist: TWEEN_SCENE camera, Signals.PlayerDied.
```

---

## Story 7 ‚Äî Mall Greybox Environment (Design Integration) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Experience Beat**: A readable layout: Atrium hub, two stores, maintenance corridor; traversal is frictionless.

```prompt
Build greybox map for traversal and tagging.
Context: Use `CollectionService` tags: `LootCrate`, `BarricadeAnchor`, `AtriumSpawn`.
Goal: `.rbxl` file with playtestable navmesh; no unintentional fall/clips.
Acceptance:
- Player can walk end‚Äëto‚Äëend; pathfinding works; anchors placed logically.
- Lighting volumes feel distinct by zone (Atrium brighter than stores).
Files: `workspace/MallGreybox.rbxm`.
Test: 5‚Äëminute walk test; pathfinding from enemy spawns to barricades.
Sequence: precedes Story 2/3/4 as spatial foundation.
Checklist: Zone naming, tags audited, safe slopes < 30¬∞.
```

**REFACTOR COMPLETED** (sculptor/refactor-sprint1-story7):
- ‚úÖ Enhanced `MallBuilder.server.lua` with improved spatial definition

```prompt
Create shared LightingPresets module per /docs/ux-context.md.
Context: Used by LightingController and tests.
Goal: Export Day/Night/Dawn with exact tokens.
Acceptance:
- Values match context file; unit test verifies keys exist and types are correct.
Files: `ReplicatedStorage/Shared/LightingPresets.lua`.
Test: Manually apply presets; visual QA.
Sequence: precedes Story 1.
Checklist: Token parity with context.
```

**Refactor Completion Notes (Oct 2025):**
- ‚úÖ Refactored `LightingPresets.lua` to match exact specification from `/docs/design_notes/ux-context.md`
- ‚úÖ Added **Dawn** phase (was missing in original implementation)
- ‚úÖ Updated all properties to match authoritative tokens: Ambient, OutdoorAmbient, FogColor, FogStart, FogEnd, ColorShift_Top, ColorShift_Bottom, Brightness, ExposureCompensation

## Story 9 ‚Äî HUD Wireframe (Design)
**Experience Beat**: Establish spatial rules so later additions don‚Äôt drift.

```prompt
Create HUD wireframe as a reference.
Context: Define safe zones and anchor points for icons, timer, banner.
Goal: Build Studio frame with placeholders OR attach a static mock to `/docs/design_notes.md` (optional if Studio frame exists).
Acceptance:
- Readable on 1080p and mobile portrait; tap targets >=24 px.
- Uses `HUD_Root`, `UI_IconPrimary`, `UI_Banner` components.
Files: `StarterGui/HUD/Wireframe.mockup` or docs reference.
Test: Resize viewport; verify layout adherence.
Sequence: precedes Story 5.
Checklist: Font sizes, padding tokens, UIScale.
```

## Story 10 ‚Äî Monetization Hooks (Foundation)
**Experience Beat**: A visible but inert shop entry ‚Äî a reminder of progression without distracting the core loop.

```prompt
Stub soft currency and shop button.
Context: Economy real logic in Sprint 2.
Goal: Add `Coins` IntValue to player data; put `Shop` button in HUD; open/close mock panel.
Acceptance:
- Currency persists within session; button opens panel; no purchases.
- Panel uses `UI_Panel` component; respects UI scale rules.
Files: `ReplicatedStorage/Shared/Currency.lua`, `StarterGui/HUD/ShopButton.client.lua`.
